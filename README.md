# JavaSnake
* Author: Kai Sorensen
* Date of Creation: Late March 2022

## Overview
  This one java file creates a Snake game in a GUI. Controls are WASD
  or the arrow keys. When you die it automatically resets. Download the
  file and change the instance variables to bend the rules :)
  
## Reflection
  I'm writing this reflection about a year after completing the game.
  I wrote this Java file in about three days during one of my school
  breaks. I was much less proficient at thinking modularly at the time,
  but this code does the job. Also, I didn't document or comment my code
  at the time, so I can't even understand how some of it works without
  walking through the code myself. That's a productive lesson to learn.
  
  As this was my first time creating a video game, I was ammused with some
  of the bugs I encountered. Unfortunately, I don't remember what they were,
  but there were about three that took significant time to correct. One of
  the more challenging (at the time) features to implement was allowing the
  user to play two moves in one frame, and to execute those moves in order
  in the proceeding two frames.
  
## Compile and Run
  From command line:
  ```
  javac SnakeBoard.java
  ```
  ```
  java Snakeboard
  ```
